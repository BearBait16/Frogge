# Fitness Frogs

## Overview
**Fitness Frogs** is an iOS app designed to help you build healthy exercise habits with a fun buddy system! Often, we set resolutions that fizzle out over time, leading to stagnation in our fitness journeys. Fitness Frogs aims to solve this issue by rewarding consistent habit creation and keeping you motivated.

## Features

### Habit Tracking
Fitness Frogs leverages the **HealthKit** iOS development package to access the workouts you are already logging. The app rewards you based on the frequency and type of your workouts. As you accumulate workouts, you can upgrade your egg to a tadpole, and with continued effort, your tadpole can transform into various types of frogs, each representing your fitness progress!

### Consistency Matters
Be mindful—if you don’t work out at least **3 days a week**, your little buddy will perish! While you can nurture your Fitness Frog back to life with renewed consistency, maintaining a regular workout routine is crucial to keep them happy and thriving. Don’t let your frogs down!

### Widget Feature
Want instant encouragement? You can soon add a widget to your home screen that displays your workout count and your favorite frog! This feature keeps your fitness goals front and center, helping you stay motivated and feel great every day!
